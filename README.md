A Simple 5-stage CPU pipeline simulator using Logisim. 

## Installation

Just type the command
```
java -jar logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar
```

It will start the Logisim Simulator and then open the project files to run them

## Usage

To run the programs first convert their instructions in integers and then load the programs so obtained in the processor and then run the simulator. The output of the program can be checked by seeing the value of individual registers after the execution finishes. 

There are some custum programs already present in the project directory.
